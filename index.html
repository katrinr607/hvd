        Lights go down, and the night is calling to me, yeah. 
        I hear voices singing songs in the street. 
        And I know that we won't be going home for so long, for so long. 
        But I know that I won't be on my own, yeah. 
        I love this feeling and right now I wish you were here with me. 
        'Cause right now everything is new to me. 
        You know I can't fight the feeling, and every night I feel it. 
        Right now I wish you were here with me...
