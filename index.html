        That I had days full of you, you Before it winds down into The memories, It's all just memories Don't you love when I come around
        Build you up then I take you down Don't you love when I come around Build you up then I take... Oooooooh, who would've thought I'd get you
        Oooooooh, who would've thought I'd get you This feels like summer Boy you make me feel so alive Just be my lover Boy you'll lead me to paradise
        Love you like a brother Treat you like a friend Respect you like a lover Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
