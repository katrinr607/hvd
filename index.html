        Baby, I'm here, I'm here to stay, I ain't going nowhere
        I know you're scared 'cause you've been hurt, baby, it's alright
        Lost in your eyes every time that you look in mine
        Promise to be all that you need, I won't leave you, baby
        No, 'cause I just wanna love you
        I will never ever put nobody up above you
        I just wanna kiss you, baby
        I just wanna hug you 'til the end, baby, 'til the end

        'Cause I'm right here, ain't nobody gotta hold ya
        'Cause I'm right here, ain't nobody gon' control ya
        'Cause I'm right right here, yeah yeah

        Say you'll be mine, say we'll be fine, say we'll be together
        Selfish of me to ask, since I be the reason we don't last forever
        Wished that you knew all that I do to make this thing go right

        And I say, good girl's got her mind right
        She been raised right, being patient I know you waiting
        Waiting on the good things when the time's right
        You should let me get to know you, baby

        Those innocent eyes, that smile on your face
        Makes it easy to trust you
        If they only knew, the girl with the tattoo like I do
        Just don't lose yourself along the way

        Through drought and famine, natural disasters
        My baby has been around for me
        Kingdoms have fallen, angels be calling
        None of that could ever make me leave
        Every time I look into your eyes I see it
        You're all I need

        Even when the sky comes falling
        Even when the sun don't shine
        I got faith in you and I
        So put your pretty little hand in mine
        'Cause this love is a sure thing

        Valentina, baby, I only need one moment of time
        To make you feel away
        From the first time I looked in your eyes
        I knew that I would find a way to make you mine...

        Catch me, I've fallen in love for the first time
        For you I drop the tough guy shit
        Thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout you
        Damn it feel good to have you
        
        You are now the reason that I fight
        I ain't never did nothing this right in my whole life
        Am I worthy of this gift?
        Am I strong enough to lift?
        Someone more important than me?
        
        I wanna cry, and I ain't even tryna fight it
        Don't wanna die, 'cause now you're here
        And I just wanna be right by your side
        I never felt so alive.
